\section{Introduction}
\label{SIntro}
This document provides a description of the LISACode software. LISACode simulates the LISA  gravitational wave (GW) detector. It does not aim to simulate in detail the detector itself but rather it makes use of the response function of its main components, particularly in the way they will affect the noise level of the detector response. It also includes an implementation of the TDI (Time Delay Interferometry) technique which allows to suppress the noise level of the lasers. \\

The main inputs and outputs of LISACode are time-dependent sequences that will describe, for input and as a function of time, the GW strain  and for output, and also as a function of time, the phasemeters response or their treatment via various TDI combination, in order to remove the laser noise level. \\

A number of  elementary GW signals can be defined , but also it's possible to use the code in conjunction with more sophisticated GW simulators via intermediate data files. \\

The main outputs of the code will be a number of time dependent data signals which will be produced either directly from the phasemeters or from a TDI treatment of these. \\

This document describes, in section~\ref{SCode}, the structure of the code. Section~\ref{SInstall}  will explain how the code can be installed on a variety of platforms. Section~\ref{SUse} describes the use of LISACode The section~\ref{SConfigFile} describes the configuration file, a list of the main parameters that controls its operations and output.  \\

More scientific information on LISACode are available in article of A.Petiteau \cite{LISACode}.

\section{A description of the Code}
\label{SCode}
This software is written in C++ for use the modularity of the object programming. The main structure of LISACode is shown in the figure \ref{Struct_LISACode}. This structure maps the main components of the LISA detector as well as its physical inputs.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering \includegraphics[width=14cm]{Figures/Structure.eps}
\caption{\small Structure of simulator LISACode. The \textcolor{red}{red} boxes represent the main modules and the \textcolor{green}{green} boxes the interface modules. The module's generic name is in \textcolor{blue}{blue}.\small} 
\label{Struct_LISACode}
\end{figure}

There are 9 libraries : 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Outils\_Maths} : Objects use like tools the others modules : vector, filters, ...
\item {\em Ondes\_Gravit} : Model \textbf{gravitational waves (GW)}.
\item {\em Orbitographie} : Model spacecraft orbits.
\item {\em Bruits} : Model noises.
\item {\em USO\_Temps} : Model ultra-stable oscillators.
\item {\em Memoire} : Manage memories for output data of each spacecraft.
\item {\em Input\_Data} : Read configuration of simulator.
\item {\em Detecteur} : Model LISA detector : Arm response at gravitational waves, phasemeters, general running.
\item {\em TDI} : Apply TDI generator.
\end{itemize}

The figure \ref{Org_LISACode} shows the organisation of the libraries used by LISACode. \\

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering \includegraphics[width=15cm]{Figures/OrgPackage.eps}
\caption{\small Organisation and dependency  for simulator's libraries. The  \textcolor{green}{green} boxes represent objects, the \textcolor{red}{red} boxes the libraries and the \textcolor{pink}{pink} boxes the executables.\small} 
\label{Org_LISACode}
\end{figure}

The first input is the GW itself. It can be defined either internally through some models which produce signals from any monochromatic sources, binary system with fixed frequency or binary system computed in Post-Newtonian approximation (1 or 2.5 PN). The GW can also be inputted via a GW time sequence as may be produced by more sophisticated simulator codes.  \\

The orbits of LISA are generated internally via the code. They correspond to realistic orbits that contain both the breathing and rotation modes of LISA as a function of its rotation around the sun. The parameters of these orbits can be adjusted in order to modify the average distance between the satellites (nominally $5 \times 10^{9} \; m$) or be defined in such a way as to keep LISA at a fix and given location. The initial location of the orbits can also be defined at input.\\

An important ingredient of the LISA response and hence of the codes are the noise inputs of different nature. These include the optical noise due to shot noise and related factors as described in table \ref{table_error}. The inertial mass and the laser noises can also be defined at input. Normally, these noise are defined as bandwidth limited white noise but different shapes of noise can be used.

Using the orbits, the response of LISA to the GW will be calculated and a relative frequency fluctuation (unit in $\Delta \nu \over \nu$) will be inputted to the Phasemeter Module. These will be combined with the different noise contribution to produce the primary phasemeter output signal which then will be processed through a elliptic filtering module. This filter is low-pass filter which cuts the frequency at half of measurement frequency for cancel the spectrum aliased. In standard operation, the primary signal will be produced at a 0.5 Hz signal and outputted, after filtering, at a 1 Hz rate. \\

This signal can be saved on a disk file and/or processed by a TDI module using a variety of TDI combinations that are defined at input. A  detailed description of TDI combination can be found in ref \cite{TDIVinet} and in ref \cite{TDITinto}. \\

The above description of the code provides only a brief summary of its capabilities. 
%The next section will provide a (non-exhaustive) list of the parameters that can be used to control the input, the processing and the output of the code and will therefore give a more complete idea of its possibilities.

%  INSTALLATION  %
%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Install}
\label{SInstall}
\subsection{System requirements}
\label{SSSystReq}
This software can be installed on UNIX system which have a standard C and C++ compiler.\\
There is also a Windows executable (tested only for Windows XP).\\ 

%
%   UNIX
%
\subsection{For Unix, Linux, Mac OS X}
\label{SSInstallUNIX}
\subsubsection{Install}
\label{SSSInstallUNIX}
The installation is the same as a standard UNIX software. The following procedure describes the installation steps : 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the package lisacode-1.4.4.tar.gz\\ (on the web : http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/Downloads/lisa/LISACode/ )\\ and move the package in the directory ({\it MyDirectory} in the example) where you want to install LISACode.
\item Uncompress the package : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{tar xvzf lisacode-1.4.4.tar.gz }\\
\item Go in the {\it LISA\_Sim\_Tdi} directory :\\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{cd MyDirectory/lisacode-1.4.4 }\\
\item Execute configuration scipt, {\it configure}, for make the {\it makefile} : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{./configure}\\
It's possible to add  compilation options and the directory where the executable will be installed (see the part \ref{SSSInstallConfig} or the file {\it INSTALL} for more technicalities on this two points).
\item Execute the {\it makefile} for compile the code : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{make}
\item If you want to install the simulator with your computer's executables or in specified directory, use the command : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{make install}
\end{enumerate}

If the software has been installed correctly, there are 3 main executables in the directory {\it MyDirectory/lisacode-1.4.4/Main/Test}. The 3 main executables are :
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em LISACode} : The main simulator executable which models gravitational wave, processes them in LISA detector and apply TDI on the output data.
\item {\em DnonGW} : Executable which gives relative frequency fluctuations on the beams made by gravitational waves.
\item {\em TDIApply} : Apply TDI generators on phasemeters output data.
\end{itemize}
If you use {\it make install} for compile, the 3 executables are also in the directory {\it bin} located with your computer's executable or in specified directory {\it MyExe/bin}. There are also many test executable in this directory.\\

For more useful, copy the executables in your work directory (the directory where you want to make LISA simulation).


\subsubsection{Install configuration}
\label{SSSInstallConfig}
Many installation options are detailed in the file {\it INSTALL} located in {\it MyDirectory/lisacode-1.4.4}.\\

IMPORTANT : If the configuration phase failed with the follozing message : \\
{\tt configure: error: fftw3 is required but it's not find! Install or link it first!} \\
you must include explicitly the directory which contains the {\bf fftw3} as : \\
 {\tt ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/pathfftw3/include LDFLAGS=-L/pathfftw3/lib} \\

The compilation options should be specified with the configuration. After \texttt{./configure}, enter \texttt{CXXFLAGS=} followed by compilation options. For example, to optimise the compilation on PowerPCG5, the option is {\it -O3 -fast} therefore the configuration command is : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fast -Wno-deprecated"} \\ 

It also possible to specify the path of the directory where the executables will be installed, with the command \texttt{make install}. Enter \texttt{--prefix=} followed by the directory path. For example, the configuration command may be used on PowerPCG5 with exectables in the directory {\it MyExe} is : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fast -Wno-deprecated" --prefix="MyExe"} \\

\subsubsection{Running test}
\label{SSSTestFonctUNIX}
For test the running of LISACode, use configuration file ({\it ConfigRefBase}) with the followed instructions : \\
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Copy the file {\it ConfigRefBase} located in {\it MyDirectory/lisacode-1.4}, in any worked directory.
\item Go in LISACode directory {\it MyDirectory/lisacode-1.4}.
\item Launch the simulator : Execute {\it LISACode} followed by the name of the configuration file  {\it ConfigRefBase} then  "123456" (seed of random generator). \\
If you use {\it make} for configuration, enter : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Main/bin/LISACode ConfigRefBase 123456} \\
Else, if you use {\it make install} for configuration, enter : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{MyExe/LISACode ConfigRefBase 123456}
\end{enumerate}
The software run during about 10 secondes or 3 minutes , for make 10 000 s of simulation. The final display is : \\
\texttt{...}\\
\texttt{9787 s    (remaining time : 00:00:00) \#0098 \%} \\

\subsection{For Windows}
\label{SWindows}
There is a LISACode executable for Windows which is tested on Windows XP.
\subsubsection{Install}
\label{SSInstallWindows}
There isn''t really install ; just download the package {\it LISACode\_1\_3\_for\_Windows.zip}  at : \\
 {\it http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/Downloads/lisa/LISACode/version-1.3/}.\\
Uncompress the package and run  LISACode.exe.
\subsubsection{Test}
\label{SSSTestFonctWindows}
It's possible to test the running of LISACode with the configuration file ({\it ConfigRefBase}) which is located in the same directory than the executable. Follow this instructions : \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open MS-DOS terminal and go to the executable where there are LISACode executable and run the configuration file {\it ConfigRefBase} (\texttt{cd ...} ).
\item Run the simulator : {\it LISACode} followed by the name of the configuration file  ({\it ConfigRefBase}) and "123456" (seed of random generator) . \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{LISACode.exe ConfigRefBase 123456}
\end{enumerate}
The result is the same than~\ref{SSSTestFonctUNIX}.

\section{Use LISACode}
\label{SUse}
\subsection{Ex\'ecution of simulator and the two annexe softwares}
\label{SSExecution}
The main software which make all the simulation (from gravitational waves to TDI) is called LISACode.
For configure the simulation the software read informations in the configuration file. This configuration file may be two type : ASCII or XML. The technicalities of this configuration file is gave in the part \ref{SSConfigFile}. The path of the output files is in the configuration file. For launch a simulation, enter LISACode executable path followed by the configuration file path : \\
\hphantom{aaa}\texttt{./LISACode configuration\_file}\\
{\it(if the LISACode executable is in the work directory)}\\
\hphantom{aaa}ou\\
\hphantom{aaa}\texttt{MyExe/LISACode configuration\_file}\\
{\it(if the LISACode executable isn't in the work directory)}\\

There are two others executables which also read information on configuration file. They make only one parts of the simulation : \\
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it \bf DnonGW} : This program computes the relative frequency fluctuations on the laser beam which arrive on each phasemeter with only the gravitational response.  There are 3 output files which have always the same name : \\
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it DnGW\_GW.txt} : Time evolution of gravitational waves' polarisation components $h_+$ and $h_\times$.
\item {\it DnGW\_Position.txt} : Time evolution of spacecrafts' ecliptic coordinates.
\item {\it DnGW\_TDelay.txt} : Time evolution of flightpath between spacecraft.
\item {\it DnGW\_SigFctTrGW.txt} : Time evolution of relative frequency fluctuation for external laser beams which arrive on each spacecraft.
\end{itemize}
The time parameters are specified in configuration file.\\

\item {\it \bf TDIApply} : This program apply TDI generator specified in configuration file, on phasemeter raw data read in files specified in configuration file. The output contains time evolution for each TDI generator. The name of this ouput file is specified in configuration file.
\end{itemize}

% Configuration par fichier ASCII

\subsection{Configuration par fichier ASCII}
\label{SSConfACII}
\textcolor{red}{The english version si not finished !} 

LISACode can read information of simulation in ASCII configuration file. The syntax of this file obeys certain very strict rules :
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{\bf Toutes les lignes se terminent par un point virgule pr\'ec\'ed\'e d'un espace (“ ;”)} que ce soit des lignes de commandes ou des lignes de commentaires.
\item Chaque bloc de caracteres doit etre separe du suivant par un espace.
\item Pour qu'une ligne soit en commentaire, il faut qu’elle commence par un "\#" suivi d'un espace.
\item C'est le premier mot d'une ligne (mot cl\'e principal) qui renseigne sur l'information que contient la ligne. Il existe 9 mots cl\'es principaux qui sont : \texttt{Time}, \texttt{Interpolation}, \texttt{TDIDelayApprox} , \texttt{Orbits}, \texttt{Detector}, \texttt{Record}, \texttt{GW}, \texttt{Noise}, \texttt{USO} et \texttt{TDI}. Le mot cl\'e principal est toujours suivi de ":".
\item La commande "END" stoppe la lecture du fichier de configuration.
\end{itemize}

% Configuration des temps
\subsubsection{Configuration des temps}
\label{SSSConfigTime}
Le mot cl\'e principal d'une ligne de configuration d'un param\`etre temporel est  \texttt{Time}. Une liste des parametres est donnee dans la tableau \ref{table_paramTime}. Les diff\'erents param\`etres temporels et les lignes les configurant sont :
\begin{itemize}
\item { \it Pas de temps physique} : C'est le pas de temps le plus petit de la simulation. Il correspond \`a la simulation des ph\'enom\`enes continus.\\
Ligne de configuration pour un pas de temps physique de 0.5 s : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Time : StepPhysic 0.5 ;}  \\

\item { \it Pas de temps sur la prise de mesure } : C'est le pas de temps sur la prise des mesures par les phasem\`etres. Il correspond au pas de temps sur les donn\'ees de sortie et donc sur les resultats de TDI. \\
Ligne de configuration pour un pas de temps sur la prise de mesure de 1 s : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Time : StepMeasure 1 ;}  \\ 

\item { \it Dur\'ee de la simulation } : C'est le temps que dure la simulation. \\
Ligne de configuration pour une simulation de 10000 s : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Time : Max 10000 ;}  \\ 

\item { \it Impr\'ecision de l'information sur les temps de parcours} : Cette incertitude temporelle correspond \`a l'impr\'ecision sur la connaissance du temps de propagation le long des bras de LISA. C'est une erreur $\Delta D$ ajout\'ee sur les temps de parcours exacts $D_{real} = L_{real} / c$ avant leur utilisation par TDI. Les temps de parcours utilis\'es dans TDI $D_{TDI}$ sont donc : \\
\begin{equation}
D_{TDI} = D_{real} + \Delta D
\end{equation}
Ligne de configuration pour une impr\'ecision sur les retards de $10^{-6}$ s: \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Time : DeltaTDIDelay 1e-6 ;}  \\ 

\item { \it Pas de temps sur l'affichage} : Pas de temps sur l'affichage \`a l'\'ecran. Il permet a l'utilisateur de suivre l'evolution de la simulation.\\
Ligne de configuration pour un pas de temps d'affichage de 1000  s: \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Time : StepDisplay 1000 ;}  \\ 
\end{itemize}

%  Configuration de l'interpolation
\subsubsection{Configuration de l'interpolation}
\label{SSSConfigInterpolation}
Le mot cl\'e principal d'une ligne de configuration de l'interpolation est  \texttt{Interpolation}.   Il existe pour l'instant un seul type d'interpolation : l'interpolation lagrangienne
\begin{itemize}
\item { \it Interpolation dans l'application de TDI } : C'est le type d'interpolation faite sur les donn\'ees brutes de sorite des phasemetres lors de l'application des retards dans TDI. On interpole pour obtenir la valeur la plus realiste possible entre 2 mesures. Pour l'interpolation lagrangienne, on pr\'ecise l'ordre de l'interpolation.\\
Ligne de configuration pour d\'efinir l'interpolation dans l'application de TDI : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Interpolation : LAG 20 ;}  \\
\end{itemize}

% Approximation des retards dans l'application de TDI
\subsubsection{Approximation des retards dans l'application de TDI}
\label{SSSConfigTDIQuick}
Il est possible d'accelerer le calcul de TDI en effectuant un calcul moins exact des retards. En effet lorsque l'on calcul le retard global a appliquer sur une mesure, il faut combiner les retards, en interpolant la valeur de chaque retard a partir des precedents. Par exemple le calcul normal d'un ''pack TDI'' est : 
\begin{equation}
D_{1} D_{2} D_{3} s_{2} = s_{2} \left( t - \left(  {L_{1}(t) \over c} + {L_{2} \left(t - {L_{1}(t) \over c} \right) \over c} + {L_{3}  \left( t - \left( {L_{1}(t) \over c} + {L_{2} \left(t - {L_{1}(t) \over c} \right) \over c} \right) \right) \over c}  \right)  \right)
\end{equation}
Lorsque l'on simplifie le calcul, les retards sont simplement pris a t et somm\'es sans interpolation. Soit pour l'example precedent :
\begin{equation}
D_{1} D_{2} D_{3} s_{2} = s_{2} \left( t - \left(  {L_{1}(t) \over c} + {L_{2}(t) \over c} + {L_{3}(t)  \over c}  \right)  \right)
\end{equation}
L'acceleration vient du fait que l'on a beaucoup moins d'interpolation a calculer.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{\it Delay approximation} :  La ligne de configuration pour effectuer un calcul approximatif rapide de TDI est : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{TDIDelayApprox : off ;}  \\
\end{itemize}

% Configuration des orbites et du temps de parcours
\subsubsection{Configuration des orbites et du temps de parcours}
\label{SSSConfigOrbits}
Le mot cl\'e principal d'une ligne de configuration des orbites est  \texttt{Orbits}. Une liste des parametres est donnee dans la tableau \ref{table_paramOrbits}.
\begin{itemize}

\item { \it Longueur des bras } : Sp\'ecifie la longueur nominal des bras de LISA.\\
Ligne de configuration pour d\'efinir une longueur de bras nominal de $5 \times 10^{9} m$ : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Orbits : Armlength 5e9 ;}  \\

\item { \it Temps initial des orbites } : Ce param\`etre temporel permet de d\'emarrer la simulation avec une position des satellites diff\'erentes de la configuartion de base. La configuration de base corresponds au position du tableau  \ref{table_flexing} soit le satellite 1 sur l'axe x et en dessous du plan de l'\'ecliptique et satellite 2 et 3 au dessus avec 2 en $y < 0$ et 3 en $y > 0$.\\
Ligne de configuration pour d\'efinir un temps de d\'emarrage des orbites de $5 \times 10^{6} s$ apr\`es la configuration initiale : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Orbits : StartTime 5e6 ;}  \\

\item { \it Phase initial de rotation du triangle } : Ce param\`etre temporel permet de changer la position au temps 0 des satellites (temps courant  + temps initial des orbites) par rapport a la configuration de base definie dans la tableau \ref{table_flexing}. Elle correspond a un angle (en radians) de rotation dans le plan par rapport a la configuration de base. \\
Ligne de configuration pour d\'efinir un angle de rotation de $ \pi / 6$ par rapport a la configuration de base : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Orbits : InitialRotation 0.523598776 ;}  \\

\item { \it Mouvement des satellites } : Ce param\`etre permet de mettre en mouvement ou non les satellites de LISA. On met \texttt{Off} pour fixer les satellites et \texttt{On} pour les mettre en mouvement.\\
Ligne de configuration pour d\'efinir une simulation avec LISA mobile : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Orbits : Move On ;}  \\

\item { \it Ordre dans le calcul des temps de propagation } : Ce param\`etre sp\'ecifie la precision avec lequel est fait le calcul du temps de parcours des photons entre satellites. Le parametre est a 0 pour un calcul classique considerant uniquement la distance entre satellite. Il est a1 pour un calcul tenant compte de l'effet Sagnac du a la rotation du trianlge c'est-a-dire que le long d'un meme bras les temps parcours different. Il est 2 pour un calcul tenant compte des effets de la relativit\'e g\'en\'erale. Si les satellites sont fixes (\texttt{Move Off}), on ne peut pas sp\'ecifier un autre ordre que 0.\\

\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{Orbits : Order 2 ;}  \\

% Configuration des ondes gravitationnelles
\subsubsection{Configuration des ondes gravitationnelles}
\label{SSSConfigGW}
Le mot cl\'e principal d'une ligne de configuration d'une onde gravitationnelle est \texttt{GW}.  Une liste des parametres est donnee dans la tableau \ref{table_paramGW}.  More scientific information on LISACode gravitational waves are available in article of A.Petiteau \cite{LISACode}. Il existe 4 types d'onde gravitationnelle possibles dans le simulateur. Chaque param\`etre est d\'efini, en pr\'ec\'edent la valeur, d'un mot cl\'e correspondant au param\`etre. Pour tous les types d'onde, on pr\'ecise juste apr\`es "\texttt{GW}", la direction de la source en coordonn\'ees \'ecliptiques ($\beta \in \left[ -90^{o} , 90^{o} \right] \rightarrow$ \texttt{\{Bet\}}, $\lambda \in \left[ 0^{o} , 360^{o} \right] \rightarrow$ \texttt{\{Lam\}}) et l'angle de polarisation $\Psi \in \left[ 0^{o} , 360^{o} \right] \rightarrow$ \texttt{\{Psi\}}. Ces 3 angles sont schematise sur la figure \ref{GWParameters}.  Attention ils sont d\'efinis en degr\'ees. Par exemple pour une onde dont la source est \`a $\beta = 27^{o}$ et $\lambda = 297^{o}$ et dont l'angle de polarisation $\psi = 229^{o}$, le d\'ebut de la ligne de configuration est : \\
\hphantom{aaaaa}\texttt{GW : Bet 27.0 , Lam 297.0 , Psi 229.0 : ... ;}  \\

\begin{itemize}
\item { \it Onde gravitationnelle monochromatique } \texttt{\{Mono\}} : Onde gravitationnelle monochromatique dont on d\'efinit la fr\'equence \texttt{\{f\}}, l'amplitude de chaque composante de polarisation ($h_{+0}$ \texttt{\{hp\}} et $h_{\times 0} $ \texttt{\{hc\}}) et la phase initiale (en radians) de chaque composante de polarisation($\Phi_{+0}$ \texttt{\{Phi0hp\}} et $\Phi_{\times 0} $ \texttt{\{Phi0hc\}}). L'evolution temporelle des contraintes gravitationnelles de l'onde dans le referentiel propre de l'onde (CFR : Canonical Reference Frame) ${h}_{CFR+} (t)$ et ${h}_{CFR\times} (t)$ correspond a :
\begin{equation} 
\left\{ \begin{array}{lll}  
{h}_{CFR+} (t) & = & h_{0+}  \sin \left( 2 \pi f t + \phi_{0+}\right)\\

% Configuration des bruits
\subsubsection{Configuration des bruits}
\label{SSSConfigGW}
Le mot cl\'e principal d'une ligne de configuration des bruits est \texttt{Noise}. Une liste des parametres est donnee dans la tableau \ref{table_paramNoise}. La configuration d'un bruit se fait ensuite en deux \'etapes : la localisation du bruit puis sa nature. La localisation du bruit se fait par le mot cl\'e correspondant \`a la situation du bruit : \texttt{Laser} pour le bruit issu d'un laser  - \texttt{Mass} pour le bruit sur une masse inertielle - \texttt{Shot} pour le bruit de "shot noise" - \texttt{OOPN} pour le bruit des autres bruits de chemin optique (autre que le "shot noise"). Le mot cl\'e de localisation est suivi du num\'ero du satellite (1, 2 et 3) puis le "sens" du banc : 0 si le banc est dans le "sens direct " ($1\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 1$), 1 s'il est dans le "sens indirect" ($1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 1$). On sp\'ecifie ensuite la nature du bruit : \\
\begin{itemize}

\item { \it Bruit blanc }  \texttt{\{White\}}: Mod\'elisation d'un bruit blanc de densit\'e spectrale de puissance donn\'ee.\\
Ligne de configuration pour d\'efinir un bruit blanc de densit\'e spectrale de puissance $10^{-13}$ (sans dimension car exprim\'e en variation relative de fr\'equence) sur le laser du banc optique du satellite 1 en vis-\`a-vis avec le satellite 2 :\\

\item { \it Bruit filtr\'e pour une \'evolution en $1/f$ de l'amplitude (ou $\sqrt{PSD}$)} \texttt{\{Filter\_1of\}}: Mod\'elisation d'un bruit dont l'amplitude \'evolue en $1/f$. La seule valeur \`a sp\'ecifier est le niveau du bruit $A_{\delta \nu / \nu}$ en $Hz^{1/2}$  c'est-\`a-dire l'amplitude (ou $\sqrt{PSD}$) tel que $PSD_{\delta \nu / \nu} = A^2_{\delta \nu / \nu} f^{-2}$ . Les coefficients sont ensuite automatiquement calcul\'es par rapport au pas de temps\footnote{Les coefficients du filtre pour un bruit en $PSD_{\delta \nu / \nu} = A^2_{\delta \nu / \nu} f^{-2}$ sont : $\alpha_{1} = 1$ et $\beta_{0} = \beta_{1} = {A_{\delta \nu / \nu} \pi \Delta t} $ }.\\
Par exemple, le bruit d'une masse inertielle est generalement exprime comme un bruit d'acceleration en $m.s^{-2}.Hz^{-1/2}$: $\sqrt{S_{\Delta a , MI }} = 3 \times 10^{-15} m.s^{-2}.Hz^{-1/2}$ . Le calcul du $A_{\delta \nu / \nu , MI}$ est alors : 
\begin{equation}

Le mot cl\'e principal d'une ligne de configuration d'un oscillateur ultra-stable est \texttt{USO}. Une liste des parametres est donnee dans la tableau \ref{table_paramNoise}. Il faut tout d'abord d\'efinir le satellite auquel l'USO appartient : pour cela on pr\'ec\`ede le num\'ero du satellite du mot cl\'e SC. On peut ensuite d\'efinir 3 param\`etres pour un oscillateur ultra-stable (USO) :  un offset \texttt{[offset]} en seconde, une d\'erive dans le temps en seconde par seconde \texttt{[derivs]} et le $\sigma$ d'un bruit blanc gaussien \texttt{[noise]} en seconde. Ces param\`etres sont sp\'ecifi\'es en pr\'ec\'edent la valeur par le mot cl\'e correspondant. Si l'on ne d\'efinit pas un USO, celui-ci est suppos\'e parfait. \\
